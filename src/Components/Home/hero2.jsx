            <h2>Managed IT services</h2>
            <p>
              Managed services is the practice of outsourcing the responsibility
              for maintaining, and anticipating need for, a range of processes
              and functions, ostensibly for the purpose of improved operations
              and reduced budgetary expenditures through the reduction of
              directly-employed staff.It is an alternative to the break/fix or
              on-demand outsourcing model where the service provider performs
              on-demand services and bills the customer only for the work done.
              Managed IT services are beneficial for both large organizations
              and small businesses; new companies and established ones. Some of
              the benefits of using managed services include:
